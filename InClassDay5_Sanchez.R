# In Class "Lab" - Intro to R and Functions
# Data 2041


# This is an R script. 
# Sometimes you don't need a full report, so you don't need a .Rmd
# Put your answers in this .R file, name it InClassDay5_Yourlastname.R and
# save/commit/push as usual
# turn the repository in on Blackboard when you're done. 
# The code should be able to run on my machine with no errors. (I will check!)


### PART ONE - Review of Objects ####

# Assign your name to a variable called `my_name`
my_name <- "Gaspar Sanchez" 
# Assign the number of pets you have to a variable called `num_pets`
num_pets <- 0
# Assign the title of your favorite book as a variable called `favorite_book`
favorite_book <- "Maze Runner"
# Create a variable called `radius`, which is your favorite number
radius <- 27
# Create a variable called `area`, which is the area of a circle with that radius.
# Use the variable `radius` to calculate this. 
# Use the built-in constant `pi` for pi.
area <- pi*(radius)^2

# Create a boolean variable `too_big` that is set to TRUE if the area is larger than 100
# Use a relationship operator to do this  (don't just set it to "TRUE")
# Think: how do you check if it's larger than 10? Assign that to your new variable name. 
too_big <- area >100 

# Display the variable `my_name`
# Display the variable `area` 
# Display the variable `too_big`
my_name
area
too_big

### PART TWO ###

# Create a variable `name_length` that holds how many letters (including spaces)
# are in your name, using the variable you made above. (use the `nchar()` function)
name_length <- nchar(my_name)
# Print the number of letters in your name
print(name_length)
# Create a variable `now_doing` that is your name followed by "is programming!" 
# (use the `paste()` function)
now_doing <- paste(my_name, "is programming!")
# Make the `now_doing` variable upper case
now_doing<- toupper(now_doing)
# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to 
# variables `fav_1` and `fav_2`
fav_1 <- 7
fav_2 <- 21
# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save the new value in the
# original variable
fav_1 <- fav_1/(sqrt(201))
fav_2 <- fav_2/(sqrt(201))
# Create a variable `raw_sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the 
# `sum()` function for practice.
raw_sum <- sum(fav_1,fav_2)
# Create a variable `round_sum` that is the `raw_sum` rounded to 2 decimal places.
# Use the `round()` function.
round_sum <- round(raw_sum,2)
# Create two new variables `round_1` and `round_2` that are your `fav_1` and 
# `fav_2` variables rounded to 2 decimal places
round_1 <- round(fav_1,2)
round_2 <- round(fav_2,2)
# Create a variable `sum_round` that is the sum of the rounded values
sum_round <- sum(round_1,round_2)
# Print out both variables and compare. Are they the same?
print(round_sum)
print(sum_round)
#Yes they are the same
